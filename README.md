# Data Science in Python for Advanced Beginners
## aka "Learning Data Science by Doing Data Science and Failing Repeatedly"


```
# The plan to take over the world:

resources = ["python tutorials", "data science websites", "online courses", "books", "podcasts"]

def expand_knowledgebase(resources):

   collect(resources) # done 
   post_online(resources) #done
   discuss_w_pyladies(resources) 
   append_new(resources)
   rank(resources)
  
   easy = 0
   hard = 100
   difficulty = easy
   You = "Advanced Beginner"
   PyLadies_meetup = "Wednesday"
   Step_0 = "install and learn the basic tools like Git/GitHub, Sublime text, Jupyter, ..."
   
   while (You != "Data Scientist"): 
      if difficulty == hard:
         You = "Data Scientist"
         print "Congratulations!"
      else:
         Step 1. Define a data science problem to solve for the given difficulty level.
         Step 2. Find a real life data set and create a simplified subset of it (toy data set).
         Step 3. Find out using resources how this problem is typically solved.
         Step 4. Play with the toy data set until the problem is solved. 
         Step 5. At the PyLadies meetup:
            Step 5.1: Tell other PyLadies about the problem 
            Step 5.2: Give them your toy data set and let them try Step 4.  
         Step 6. At the PyLadies meetup + 2 weeks:
            Step 6.1: Collect all solutions
            Step 6.2: Pick the best one (the simplest one that works).
            Step 6.3: Post the best solution online.
         Step 7. Profit (the winner gets a small prize)!
