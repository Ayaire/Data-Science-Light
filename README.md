resources = ["python tutorials", "data science websites", "online courses", "books", "podcasts"]

         Step 1. Define a data science problem to solve for the given difficulty level.
         Step 2. Find a real life data set and create a simplified subset of it (sandbox data set).
         Step 3. Find out using resourses how this problem is typically solved.
         Step 4. Play with the sandbox data set until the problem is solved. 
         Step 5. Find out how the problem actually should be solved. Solve it more efficiently.
         Step 6. Tell other PyLadies about the problem, give them the sandbox set and let them try Step 4.  
         Step 7. Profit!
