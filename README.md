         Step 1. Find a small real life data set.
         Step 3. Come up with a simple question or a problem for this data set
         Step 4. Find out in ressourses how it is typically done.
         Step 5. Create a sandbox data set and play with it until the question is answered.
         Step 6. Tell other people about the problem, give them the same data set and let them try it out.
         Step 7. Profit!
