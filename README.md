###The plan to take over the world:

resources = {python websites, data science websites, books, online courses, podcasts}
```
def expand_knowledgebase(resourses):
   collect(resourses)
   post_online(resourses)
   discuss_w_pyladies(resourses)
   rank(resourses)
   append_new(resourses)

   while (Anna!=data_scientist): 
      difficulty = easy
      Step 1. Find a small real life data science problem or a data set.
      Step 3. Come up with a simple question for that data set that requires statistics or machine learning to answer.  
      Step 4. Find out in ressourses how this 
      Step 4. Create a sandbox data set and play with it until the question is answered.
      Step 5. Tell other people about the problem, give them the data set and let them try it out.
      Step 5. Profit!
